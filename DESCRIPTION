Description: This package provides Nearest Neighborhood Gaussian Process function to approximate inverse of kernel matrix K defined from the underlying latent factor model in Spatial PCA. It also provides functions to estimate loading matrix W and latent factor matrix Z by integrating output (K inverse, determinant of K) approximated by Nearest Neighborhood Gaussian Process.
