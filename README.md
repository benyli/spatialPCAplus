# spatialPCAplus

This repository will house the final group project for BIOSTAT 615 taught by Prof. Hyun Min Kang.

The project extends the work done in Shang, L. & Zhou, X (Spatially aware dimension reduction for spatial transcriptomics, _Nature communications_, 2022. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9684472/) by using NNGP to invert and hopefully improve the computational efficiency of K-matrix inversion. In addition, we will try improving the efficiency with Rcpp implementations.

The developers and maintainers of SpatialPCA+ are:
Yiren Hou, Reeta Bhanini, and Benjamin Li
